# Portfolio-React
Portfolio project for Cloud Services course. Features my projects and technical skills that I've learnt throughout school. Although it showcases my skills and projects, it's main purpose is to showcase that I know how to deploy a web app in Azure, which is why it showcases the steps I've taken to deploy it. 

You can find the web app on this URL:
https://black-smoke-0df104310.2.azurestaticapps.net/

## Deployment to Azure - Static Web Services

In the deployment of the web app, I chose **Static Web App** in Azure when creating a new resource.  
This resource was added to the resource group **portfolio-react-rg** and uses this repository to create the app and deploy it via Azure.

## CI/CD with GitHub Actions

During the process, Azure adds the workflow file to the project to enable CI/CD pipelines, which enables GitHub Actions:
